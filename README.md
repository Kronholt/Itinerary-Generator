# Itinerary-Generator


I am newer to programming, and wanted to test out a real world application in Java. 

The Itinerary Generator program first allows the user to Create an account, or access a stored account (which is read/written to a file).

Once logged in the user is able to search for flights, book trips and manage those trips.

I'll be the first to admit that I didn't code this as efficently, or as organized as I should and would love any tips or tricks to help me grow in these areas.
