# Itinerary-Generator


--I am newer to programming, and wanted to test out a real world application in Java.--

The Itinerary Generator program first allows the user to Create an account, or access a stored account (which is read/written to a file).
Once logged in the user is able to search for flights, book trips and manage those trips.

--I'll be the first to admit that I didn't code this as efficiently, or as organized as possible. 
This is the first "real" project I've undertaken besides the silly onces required in my classes, and wanted/needed some good experience. 
If you want to make edits and pull requests, please include specifically what you changed, and why. I want to learn from you.
